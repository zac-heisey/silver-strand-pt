    <h1>What We Do</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="content-intro">
    <p>Traditional physical therapy approaches use tools and techniques to treat the patient’s symptoms. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>Soft Tissue Massage</li>
      <li>Joint Mobilizations</li>
      <li>Ultrasound</li>
      <li>Electrical Stimulation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Applied Functional Science uses a total body approach to not only treat the patient’s symptoms, but to find the underlying source of their issues. Using the most authentic positioning and input to the body allows our clinicians to set the body up for success moving forward.</p>
    <p>Silver Strand Physical Therapy is located in the heart of Imperial Beach, making us the physical therapy clinic of choice for patients <a href="/physical-therapy-clinic">throughout the South Bay</a>.</p>
